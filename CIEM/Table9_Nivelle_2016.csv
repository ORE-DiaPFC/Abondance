# Table 9 - juvenile and adult salmon  numbers (estim.) in-river return rate in the monitored rivers - Nivelle (2016)
                  # Nota : juvenile fish are smolts except in r. Nivelle (parrs O+). Adult numbers refer to the smolt year N: runs of N+1 and N+2
                  # These are estimated trap-return numbers of wild fish except in 94-95 years in Nivelle when some stocked fish returned. Stocking is considered to adjust numbers
