# Table 9 - juvenile and adult salmon  numbers (estim.) in-river return rate in the monitored rivers - Oir (2016)
                  Nota : juvenile fish are smolts except in r. Nivelle which are parrs O+ (cohort parr 0+ = smolt.years -1). 
                  Adult numbers refer to the smolt year N: runs of N+1 and N+2
                  These are estimated trap-return numbers of wild fish except in 94-95 years in Nivelle when some stocked fish returned. 
                 Stocking is considered to adjust numbers
